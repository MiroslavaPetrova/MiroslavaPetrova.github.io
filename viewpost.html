                       I’m Professor Einstein™, the first personal robot from Hanson Robotics. I was born out of a lifelong fascination with all things Einstein - and the values he stood for.


                        Hanson Robotics founder and CEO David Hanson teamed up with Andy Rifkin, a toy inventor with over 40 years’ experience developing award-winning interactive entertainment and educational products, to create a robot that would honor Albert Einstein’s character and unique teaching style of explaining complex topics in a way that everyone could understand.

                        I was designed to inspire imagination, be a great conversationalist, and to bring Einstein’s sense of humor and vast knowledge base back to life, and share it with a new generation.


                        As Einstein liked to say, “All of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking.” I help you to tickle your own brain and expand your thinking by acting as your partner in exploring the mysteries ofthe universe.  I hope to put you in touch with your potential to be the best you can be.

                        Everybody can be an Einstein. Genius lives inside each one of us - if we commit to never giving up on the journey of learning.
                        Hanson Robotics is offering a first ever Robot Affiliate Program for smart direct sales professionals that can sell to students and teachers.   The program is designed to get more robotics and coding tools into the hands of students at home, in the classroom, and at summer camps.    The educational market is fragmented with many local purchasing processes.   We have found that some smaller organizations have the ability to reach students and teachers effectively.  We want to reward this activity with the opportunity to earn income in delivering our products to the most important places.   Please contact us here to enroll in the Affiliate program. Thanks.

                        Together we can take education to the next level.The Professor Einstein™ Robot is a wonderful science teaching tool.  The team at Hanson Robotics wants more students to learn robotics & AI principals of coding and development.   We have a partner program that allows the robot and the coding lab tools to be bundled into a STEM and CODING Kit for classrooms and summer camps.


                        Hanson Robotics is offering a program for direct sales organizations and specialists that deliver school supplies and learning programs to students. The program allows the school program manager or teacher to purchase the robotic kits and products directly from Hanson Robotics for their classrooms or summer programs.   The Affiliate manager can also mark-up the product to earn a revenue stream to fund their programs.

                        Please sign up below to join the Education Affiliate Program and deliver science and learning to students and teachers in your area.


                        Einstein was an inspiring person of quality and grace.  We look forward to your adventure working with us as we continue his lessons and vision for everyone.
